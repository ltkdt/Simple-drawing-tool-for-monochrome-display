This is my raylib project to draw bitmap that is meant to be displayed on an OLED screen with the resolution of 128x64 pixels. 

My basic implementation for this project is complete. I have more development plan for this project in the future, so I will keep this basic version here 
and another newer version of this in a seperate github repo (this will be done in the future)

For now you can:
 - Draw on the canvas
 - Erase pixels
 - Invert color
 - Save cpp code of your bitmap in object.cpp. Copy it to your personal project and use it to display on your oled screen
